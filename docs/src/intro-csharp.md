## First project

Create a console project and add the Playwright dependency.

```bash
# Create project
dotnet new console -n PlaywrightDemo
cd PlaywrightDemo

# Add project dependency
dotnet add package Microsoft.Playwright
# Build the project
dotnet build
# Install required browsers - replace netX with actual output folder name, f.ex. net6.0.
pwsh bin\Debug\netX\playwright.ps1 install

# If the pwsh command does not work (throws TypeNotFound), make sure to use an up-to-date version of PowerShell.
dotnet tool update --global PowerShell
```

Create a `Program.cs` that will navigate to `https://playwright.dev/dotnet` and take a screenshot in Chromium.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Playwright;

using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
await using var browser = await playwright.Chromium.LaunchAsync();
var page = await browser.NewPageAsync();
await page.GotoAsync("https://playwright.dev/dotnet");
await page.ScreenshotAsync(new PageScreenshotOptions { Path = "screenshot.png" });
```

Now run it.

```bash
dotnet run
```

By default, Playwright runs the browsers in headless mode. To see the browser UI, pass the `Headless = false` flag while launching the browser. You can also use [`option: slowMo`] to slow down execution. Learn more in the debugging tools [section](./debug.md).

```csharp
await playwright.Firefox.LaunchAsync(new BrowserTypeLaunchOptions
{
    Headless = false,
    SlowMo = 50,
});
```

## First test

You can choose to use NUnit test fixtures that come bundled with Playwright. These fixtures support running tests on multiple browser engines in parallel, out of the box. Learn more about [Playwright with NUnit](./test-runners.md).

```bash
# Create new project.
dotnet new nunit -n PlaywrightTests
cd PlaywrightTests
```

Install dependencies, build project and download necessary browsers. This is only done once per project.

```bash
# Add project dependency
dotnet add package Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit
# Build the project
dotnet build
# Install required browsers - replace netX with actual output folder name, f.ex. net6.0.
pwsh bin\Debug\netX\playwright.ps1 install
```

Edit UnitTest1.cs file.
```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit;
using NUnit.Framework;

namespace PlaywrightTests;

[Parallelizable(ParallelScope.Self)]
public class Tests : PageTest
{
    [Test]
    public async Task ShouldAdd()
    {
        int result = await Page.EvaluateAsync<int>("() => 7 + 3");
        Assert.AreEqual(10, result);
    }

    [Test]
    public async Task ShouldMultiply()
    {
        int result = await Page.EvaluateAsync<int>("() => 7 * 3");
        Assert.AreEqual(21, result);
    }
}
```

```bash
dotnet test -- NUnit.NumberOfTestWorkers=5
```

## Record scripts

[Command line tools](./cli.md) can be used to record user interactions and generate C# code.

```bash
pwsh bin\Debug\netX\playwright.ps1 codegen
```

## Install browsers via API

It's possible to run [Command line tools](./cli.md) commands via the .NET API:

```csharp
var exitCode = Microsoft.Playwright.Program.Main(new[] {"install"});
if (exitCode != 0)
{
    throw new Exception($"Playwright exited with code {exitCode}");
}
```

## Bundle drivers for different platforms

Playwright by default does bundle only the driver for the .NET publish target runtime. If you want to bundle for additional platforms, you can
override this behavior by using either `all`, `none` or `linux`, `win`, `osx` in your project file.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <PlaywrightPlatform>all</PlaywrightPlatform>
</PropertyGroup>
```

or:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <PlaywrightPlatform>osx;linux</PlaywrightPlatform>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## System requirements

The browser binaries for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit work across the 3 platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux):

### Windows

Works with Windows and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

### macOS

Requires 10.14 (Mojave) or above.

### Linux

Depending on your Linux distribution, you might need to install additional
dependencies to run the browsers.

:::note
Only Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 are officially supported.
:::

See also in the [Command line tools](./cli.md#install-system-dependencies)
which has a command to install all necessary dependencies automatically for Ubuntu
LTS releases.
