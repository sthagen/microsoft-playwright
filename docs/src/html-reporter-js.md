The HTML Reporter shows you a full report of your tests allowing you to filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests and flaky tests. By default, the HTML report is opened automatically if some of the tests failed.

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

You can click on each test to get more info on the test and explore the errors section which will show you what errors there are and on what line as well as suggestions on how to fix the errors. Each step of the test can be expanded and looked into in detail.
