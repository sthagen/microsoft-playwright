## Version 1.22

### Highlights

- Role selectors that allow selecting elements by their [ARIA role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#roles), [ARIA attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-attributes) and [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).

  ```csharp
  // Click a button with accessible name "log in"
  await page.ClickAsync("role=button[name='log in']")
  ```

  Read more in [our documentation](./selectors#role-selector).

- New [`method: Locator.filter`] API to filter an existing locator

  ```csharp
  var buttons = page.Locator("role=button");
  // ...
  var submitLocator = buttons.Filter(new LocatorFilterOptions { HasText = "Sign up" });
  await submitLocator.ClickAsync();
  ```

## Version 1.21

### Highlights

- New role selectors that allow selecting elements by their [ARIA role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#roles), [ARIA attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-attributes) and [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).

  ```csharp
  // Click a button with accessible name "log in"
  await page.ClickAsync("role=button[name='log in']")
  ```

  Read more in [our documentation](./selectors#role-selector).
- New `scale` option in [`method: Page.screenshot`] for smaller sized screenshots.
- New `caret` option in [`method: Page.screenshot`] to control text caret. Defaults to `"hide"`.
- We now ship a designated .NET docker image `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/dotnet`. Read more in [our documentation](./docker).

### Behavior Changes

- Playwright now supports large file uploads (100s of MBs) via [`method: Locator.setInputFiles`] API.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 101.0.4951.26
- Mozilla Firefox 98.0.2
- WebKit 15.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 100
- Microsoft Edge 100


## Version 1.20

### Web-First Assertions

Playwright for .NET 1.20 introduces [Web-First Assertions](./test-assertions).

Consider the following example:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit;
using NUnit.Framework;

namespace Playwright.TestingHarnessTest.NUnit;

public class ExampleTests : PageTest
{
    [Test]
    public async Task StatusBecomesSubmitted()
    {
        await Expect(Page.Locator(".status")).ToHaveTextAsync("Submitted");
    }
}
```

Playwright will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until
fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and
checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is
reached. You can pass this timeout as an option.

Read more in [our documentation](./test-assertions).

### Other Updates

- New options for methods [`method: Page.screenshot`], [`method: Locator.screenshot`] and [`method: ElementHandle.screenshot`]:
  * Option `ScreenshotAnimations.Disabled` rewinds all CSS animations and transitions to a consistent state
  * Option `mask: Locator[]` masks given elements, overlaying them with pink `#FF00FF` boxes.
- [`method: Locator.highlight`] visually reveals element(s) for easier debugging.

## Version 1.17

### Frame Locators

Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators](./api/class-framelocator) - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

Frame locators can be created with either [`method: Page.frameLocator`] or [`method: Locator.frameLocator`] method.

```csharp
var locator = page.FrameLocator("#my-frame").Locator("text=Submit");
await locator.ClickAsync();
```

Read more at [our documentation](./api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update

- [Response.AllHeadersAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-response#response-all-headers)
- [Response.HeadersArrayAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-response#response-headers-array)
- [Response.HeaderValueAsync(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-response#response-header-value)
- [Response.HeaderValuesAsync(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-response#response-header-values)

### 🌈 Forced-Colors emulation

Its now possible to emulate the `forced-colors` CSS media feature by passing it in the [context options](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-forced-colors) or calling [Page.EmulateMediaAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-page#page-emulate-media).

### New APIs

- [Page.RouteAsync()](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-page#page-route) accepts new `times` option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
- [Page.SetCheckedAsync(selector: string, checked: Boolean)](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-page#page-set-checked) and [Locator.SetCheckedAsync(selector: string, checked: Boolean)](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-set-checked) was introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.

### Important ⚠
* ⬆ .NET Core Apps 2.1 are **no longer** supported for our CLI tooling. As of August 31st, 2021, .NET Core 2.1 is no [longer supported](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-1-will-reach-end-of-support-on-august-21-2021/) and will not receive any security updates. We've decided to move the CLI forward and require .NET Core 3.1 as a minimum. 

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 96.0.4641.0
- Mozilla Firefox 92.0
- WebKit 15.0

## Version 1.14

#### ⚡️ New "strict" mode

Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Set `setStrict(true)` in your action calls to opt in.

```csharp
// This will throw if you have more than one button!
await page.ClickAsync("button", new Page.ClickOptions().setStrict(true));
```

#### 📍 New [**Locators API**](./api/class-locator)

Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](./api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](./api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](./api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```csharp
var locator = page.Locator("button");
await locator.ClickAsync();
```

Learn more in the [documentation](./api/class-locator).

#### 🧩 Experimental [**React**](./selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](./selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines

React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```csharp
await page.ClickAsync("_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]");
await page.ClickAsync("_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]");
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](./selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](./selectors#vue-selectors).

#### ✨ New [**`nth`**](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines

- [`nth`](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```csharp
// select the first button among all buttons
await button.ClickAsync("button >> nth=0");
// or if you are using locators, you can use First, Nth() and Last
await page.Locator("button").First.ClickAsync();

// click a visible button
await button.ClickAsync("button >> visible=true");
```
